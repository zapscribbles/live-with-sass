# Pricing
I can provide services at any time in you or your loved one's living or dying process.

## Pricing
I charge $75/hour for one-hour sessions. We can do as many or as few of these as you'd like, and they can be direct meetings with a dying person or with one or more of their loved ones.

When someone is actively dying, you can choose between a 2-4 hour block of time or several shorter visits, at similar rates.

No major insurances in the United States cover doula services.

> Can't pay this rate? Don't let price be a discouraging factor; I accept many **pro bono** clients.

Since I was recently trained by [INELDA](https://inelda.org/) (the International End of Life Doula Association), I am not yet certified. Certification is not a requirement to serve as a death doula, but I am working toward it. In order to get more client history for my certification process, I'm offering pro bono services to many clients.
