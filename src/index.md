# Welcome

I'm a death doula based out of Harpswell, Maine, serving the surrounding communities.

## What's a death doula?

End-of-life doulas--also known as death doulas or death guides--work with people to help make death less overwhelming and frightening.

This might involve working directly with dying individuals and their loved ones in the months, weeks, or days leading up to someone's death.

It may involve helping loved ones process someone's death, or just talking with someone about their feelings or beliefs around death.

I see my doula role as making death less unfamiliar and scary. I help those who are dying and their loved ones to go through the dying process with dignity and authenticity.

> I currently accept many clients **pro bono**. Don't let price be a discouraging factor!

## Where I work
I serve communities within a 45-minute drive of my home in Harpswell, including Brunswick, Topsham, West Bath, Bath, Woolwich, Phippsburg, Durham, Freeport, Gardiner, and Augusta. If you're not sure if I cover your area, just ask!

I'm also available for virtual sessions to a much wider area, if you're comfortable with not having me physically present.

## How to begin
See a full breakdown of my [services](/services) and [pricing](/pricing) or learn more [about me](/about).

If you're interested in working with me, let's talk for a 15-30 minute, no-charge discovery call or meeting to see if I'm a good fit to accompany you through your dying process.
