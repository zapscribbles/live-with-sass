![Kate hiking](/img/kate.jpeg "Kate hiking")

I'm a former triathlete and an Appalachian Trail thru-hiker.

When I first began endurance efforts, I focused on doing them--and living my life--with sass.

This phrase means a lot to me, but at its core, it's about:

- Doing things on your terms
- Doing things that feed your soul and feel right to you--regardless of what society at large tells you you "should" do or want
- Living life as fully and as presently as possible
- In dying and death work, these same principles apply.

In the United States, we've treated death as a medical event for far too long, when it's actually one of the two most natural, organic processes in our lives (the other being birth). If you're looking for something in addition to medical care or hospice help as you near the end of life--or if you've experienced an unexpected death or loss in your life--a doula may be a good fit.

## My training
INELDA trained doula logoI completed an in-depth training with the International End-of-Life Doula Association (INELDA) at the end of 2023.
I'm working toward becoming a certified End of Life Doula through INELDA (which is not required to practice: you must have a certain amount of practice and referrals to receive certification).

I've also completed the American Clinicians Academy on Medical Aid in Dying's (ACAMAID) training for End-Of-Life Doulas and Bedside-Attendants, which qualifies me to assist with Medical Aid in Dying under the Maine Death with Dignity Act of 2019.
